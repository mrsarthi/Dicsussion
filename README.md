# DecentraChat 

**A simple, secure, and private messaging app where you actually own your conversations.**

---

## 🤷‍♂️ What is DecentraChat?
Imagine a chat app like WhatsApp or Telegram, but without a big tech company sitting in the middle reading your messages or owning your account. 

With DecentraChat:
- **No phone numbers or emails needed.** You get a unique "Wallet Address" (a string of letters and numbers) that acts as your identity.
- **True Privacy.** Every message is locked (End-to-End Encrypted) before it leaves your device. Only the person you're talking to can unlock and read it.
- **No Central Server.** Your messages travel directly from your computer to your friend's computer. They aren't stored on some company's cloud server forever. *(We only use a temporary relay if a direct connection isn't possible, but even then, the relay can't read your locked messages!)*

## ⚙️ How does it work?
1. **Create an Account:** You click one button to generate your secure, anonymous identity. Your secret "keys" are stored only on your computer.
2. **Share your Address:** Send your unique address to your friends.
3. **Start Chatting:** Start a conversation! Messages are sent directly between you and your friends using secure peer-to-peer technology.
4. **Group Chats:** Create secure groups, invite your friends, and chat together, all completely encrypted.
